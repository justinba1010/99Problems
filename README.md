# 99Problems

This is just a fun little project I decided to play with over the summer. I will be solving the Ocaml 99 Problems Challenge in ReasonML. I found this at work, and thought it'd be fun to dedicate 30-45 min a day on.

I will also be focussing on efficiency, prepending lists, then reversing for a runtime of O(n) vs, postpending(in functional languages this is O(n^2)).

## Ocaml Aux Style

I will be using the auxilary function styling, it's just my preference.
